To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, each service could be deployed on multiple instances, and a load balancer is used to distribute requests among them.
By breaking down the system into smaller services, it becomes easier to develop and deploy each service independently. This approach also allows for scaling individual services based on their usage patterns, rather than having to scale the entire system.
## Account Service:
This service would handle the creation and management of customer accounts. It would have endpoints to create new accounts, update account information, and retrieve account information. The Account service would be responsible for managing account balances and ensuring that each account has a unique identifier. The Account service would communicate with the Transaction service to record transactions.

## Transaction Service:
This service would be responsible for recording transactions related to customer accounts. It would have endpoints to record new transactions and retrieve transaction history for a given account. The Transaction service would communicate with the Account service to verify that the account exists before recording a new transaction.

## Customer Service: 
This service would handle customer information and authentication. It would have endpoints to create and update customer information, authenticate customers, and retrieve customer information. The Customer service would communicate with the Account and Transaction services to retrieve information about customer accounts and transactions.

## Gateway Service:
This service would act as an API gateway for the entire system. It would handle authentication and routing requests to the appropriate service based on the requested endpoint. The Gateway service would communicate with the Customer service to authenticate users before allowing them to access other services.
